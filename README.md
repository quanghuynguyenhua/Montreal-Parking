# Montreal-Parking (ON-GOING)

Welcome to the Montreal Island Parking Space Tracker, an innovative project designed to revolutionize how drivers find and utilize parking spaces in Montreal. This interactive map-based solution offers real-time tracking of parking availability, incorporating various urban factors to ensure a hassle-free parking experience.
Here is the <a href= "https://quanghuynguyenhua.github.io/Montreal-Parking/">link</a> to the interactive map.

## Key Features:
Real-Time Parking Availability: Utilizing GPS and time-based data, the map shows up-to-the-minute availability of parking spaces across Montreal Island. Whether you're a resident or a visitor, easily find a spot without the usual stress.

Integration with Parking Signage: The system interprets Quebec's parking signage in French, translating complex parking rules into simple, user-friendly information not only for the locals, but also for the travellers. This feature helps drivers adhere to parking regulations and avoid fines.

Snowfall and Leaf Removal Schedules: Canada's weather conditions and maintenance schedules can impact parking availability. The project includes data on snow removal and leaf collection, adjusting available parking spots accordingly.

User-Friendly Interface: Designed with ease of use in mind, the map offers a clear, intuitive interface. Whether you're tech-savvy or not, finding a parking space is just a few clicks away.

Community-Driven Updates: Users can contribute to the accuracy of the map by reporting changes in parking availability or conditions, fostering a collaborative community spirit.

## Objective:
My goal is to visualize the parking process in Montreal Island, reducing traffic congestion caused by drivers searching for parking. By providing accurate, real-time information on parking availability, I aim to improve the overall transportation experience in the city.
